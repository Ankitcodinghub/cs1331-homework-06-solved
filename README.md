Activity 1: JavaFX

Purpose

Congratulations! Your coding skills landed you a position as the Travel Advertiser for the city of OOP-Topia. For some unknown reason this city has seen a lack in tourism lately, and the Mayor needs your expertise. You decide to think outside of the box and use your newfound knowledge of JavaFX to create the ultimate travel brochure. To complete this assignment, you will apply your knowledge of JavaFX shapes, text, and images to implement a GUI Application that will represent a travel brochure.

Solution Description

For this activity, you will be creating a JavaFX GUI Application to reflect a travel brochure. You will also have to adhere to proper Checkstyle including Javadocs.

Brochure.java

This class contains a JavaFX GUI Application that displays a travel brochure for OOP-Topia. Remember to consult the Java and JavaFX API to find information about classes and methods that are available to you to use. In this class you will do the following:

‚Ä¢ Create a window with the title of ‚ÄúTravelBrochure‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ At the top of the window there should be a blue Rectangle with ‚ÄúWELCOME TO OOP-TOPIA!‚Äù in white text on top of it.

‚Ä¢ In the center (or close to the center) of the window there should be an Image of your choosing with a sentence below it detailing how the Image relates to what a tourist can do and/or find in OOP-Topia.

o Please submit any image files you use to Gradescope and assume the image files are located in the current working directory when you refer to them in your code.

‚Ä¢ To the left and right of the Image there should be two of the same Shape in different Colors.

Activity 2: Recursion

Purpose

You decide to go undercover as a tourist in OOP-Topia to truly fulfill your advertising duties. You intend to use your recursion skills to find out how many activities in the city you can accomplish and gain some intel about what goes on inside OOP-Topia.

Solution Description

For this activity, you will be creating a recursive method within a Java file called UndercoverTourist.java. Based on a travel budget and catalog of activities with their prices, you need to recursively determine how many activities you can accomplish in the city. You are provided with a defined class called TravelActivity.java that represents an activity you can complete in OOP-Topia and contains information about its cost. You will also have to adhere to proper Checkstyle including Javadocs.

UndercoverTourist.java

This class will contain one static method that will handle the logic of recursively determining how many activities you can accomplish with a given budget.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ int calculateNumActivities(ArrayList, double, int)

o This method should be static and take in three parameters in the following order:

An ArrayList of type TravelActivity representing a catalog of activities that can be purchased in the city.

ÔÉ† Each TravelActivity has a name and price.

TravelActivity in ArrayList is unique.

A double representing your current budget.

An int value representing the current number of activities already purchased.

o You are to recursively determine the largest number of different activities you could purchase with your current budget.

Each time you recurse, you should purchase the cheapest available TravelActivity and update your budget and number of purchased activities accordingly. If there are multiple TravelActivities that have the same price, choose the TravelActivity that appears first in the catalog to purchase.

You SHOULD remove an activity from the catalog once you purchase it to ensure you do not repeat an activity.

o This method returns an int value representing the largest number of activities you could purchase with your current budget.

o Note: Searching for the cheapest activity to complete in each recursive call will result in completing the maximum possible number of activities. This is an example of a Greedy

Algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/ o Note: Each TravelActivity has its own name and price. You can view (but do NOT edit) the TravelActivity.java file.

Clarifications and Example Output

Allowed Imports

‚Ä¢ anything from the javafx library for Activity 1

‚Ä¢ java.util.ArrayList for Activity 2

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var‚ÄØ(the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

‚Ä¢ SceneBuilder

Checkstyle and Javadocs

You must run Checkstyle on your submission. The Checkstyle cap for this assignment is 15 points. If you don‚Äôt have Checkstyle yet, download it from Canvas -&gt; Modules -&gt; Checkstyle Resources (all sections) Place it in the same folder as the files you want Checkstyled. Run checkstyle on your code like so:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar yourFileName.java Starting audit‚Ä¶

Audit done.

The message above means there were no Checkstyle errors. If you had any errors, they would show up above this message, and the number at the end would be the points we would take off (limited by the Checkstyle cap mentioned above). The Java source files we provide contain no Checkstyle errors. In future homeworks we will be increasing this cap, so get into the habit of fixing these style errors early!

Additionally, you must Javadoc your code.

Run the following to only check your Javadocs:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -j yourFileName.java

Run the following to check both Javadocs and Checkstyle:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -a yourFileName.java

For additional help with Checkstyle see the CS 1331 Style Guide.

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Turn-In Procedure

Submission

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on‚ÄØGradescope:

‚Ä¢ Brochure.java

‚Ä¢ Any image files needed to run Brochure.java

‚Ä¢ UndercoverTourist.java

Please only submit the individual files‚Äîdo not put them into a package or you will risk getting a zero on the assignment. Make sure you see the message stating ‚ÄúHW06 submitted successfully‚Äù. From this point, Gradescope will run a basic autograder on your submission as discussed in the next section.

Gradescope Autograder

For each submission, you will be able to see the results of a few basic test cases on your code. Each test typically corresponds to a rubric item, and the score returned represents the performance of your code on those rubric items only. If you fail a test, you can look at the output to determine what went wrong and resubmit once you have fixed the issue.

The Gradescope tests serve two main purposes:

‚Ä¢ Prevent upload mistakes (e.g. non-compiling code)

‚Ä¢ Provide basic formatting and usage validation

In other words, the test cases on Gradescope are by no means comprehensive. Be sure to thoroughly test your code by considering edge cases and writing your own test files. You also should avoid using Gradescope to compile, run, or Checkstyle your code; you can do that locally on your machine.

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit .class files

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope

‚Ä¢ Run Checkstyle on your code to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeature Restrictions‚Äù to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for a note containing all official clarifications
